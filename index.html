				<h4>About</h4>

				<p>Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Nick Majeski, and I am a Software Engineer. In a world of constant and fast-paced technological advancement, it can be challenging to keep up with the latest trends. Fortunately, I enjoy learning about timeless and up-and-coming web technologies and engineering techniques, which helps me stay current.</p>
				<p>I am constantly striving to enhance my abilities. Aside from working for an <a href="http://www.valore.com" target="_blank">e-commerce company</a> as a full-stack Software Engineer, I sharpen my abilities by reading consistently, taking Computer Science courses, and working on my own projects.</p>
				<p>There is so much more I can tell you about myself. I am open to questions and comments of any kind, and I enjoy meeting new people. That being said, please don't hesitate to e-mail me or to connect with me via social media. Check the Contact section for links!</p>

				<h4>Experience</h4>
				<p>I have six years' experience of professional software development. In my time, I have worked mostly on the backend services of web applications. However, I truly enjoy working on the front-end, and I have been known to work both on the front-end and the back-end of applications as a full-stack developer. Having the fortune of being mentored by some really great software engineers, I was promoted from a junior software engineer to a software engineer in 2012. I am comfortable and proficient with the following technologies:</p>
